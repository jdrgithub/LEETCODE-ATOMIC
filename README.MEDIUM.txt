You said:
Ok, can you give me well commented code to illustrate for those? Also include, good explanations after the code for each as you always do. You can respond to me like a python coding teacher who knows what is best for me and has suggestions for me that I might not have thought of in terms of what to focus on. The trick here is to study the most commonly asked for problems as a start.

1. Two Sum (Hash Map)
Code:
python
Copy code
def two_sum(nums, target):
    # Create a dictionary to store the complement and its index
    complement_map = {}

    # Traverse the array
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num

        # If the complement is already in the map, we've found the solution
        if complement in complement_map:
            return [complement_map[complement], i]

        # Store the current number and its index in the map
        complement_map[num] = i

# Example usage
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]

Explanation:
Hash Map Core Mechanism: We use a dictionary to store the complements of the numbers weâ€™ve seen so far. When the complement of the current number is found in the dictionary, we return the indices.
Why Focus on This: This question is frequently asked because it tests your understanding of how hash maps provide O(1) average-time complexity for lookups, which is an essential optimization in coding.

2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Sliding Window)
Code:
python
Copy code
def length_of_longest_substring(s):
    # Dictionary to store the index of the last occurrence of each character
    char_map = {}
    max_length = 0
    start = 0

    # Sliding window approach, where 'end' is the end of the window
    for end, char in enumerate(s):
        # If the character is already in the map and within the current window, move 'start'
        if char in char_map and char_map[char] >= start:
            start = char_map[char] + 1

        # Update the character's last occurrence index
        char_map[char] = end

        # Calculate the maximum length of the substring
        max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)

    return max_length

# Example usage
s = "abcabcbb"
print(length_of_longest_substring(s))  # Output: 3

Explanation:
Sliding Window Mechanism: By moving the start pointer whenever a repeating character is found, we maintain a window of unique characters. This allows us to find the longest substring in linear time.
Why Focus on This: Sliding window techniques are common in interview questions where substring or subarray problems arise. It also demonstrates your ability to use dictionary operations to track state dynamically.

3. 3Sum (Two Pointers)
Code:
python
Copy code
def three_sum(nums):
    nums.sort()  # Sort the array to use the two-pointer technique
    result = []

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Skip duplicate values
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            continue

        # Two-pointer approach
        left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            if total == 0:
                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])

                # Move pointers and avoid duplicates
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:
                    left += 1
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:
                    right -= 1

                left += 1
                right -= 1
            elif total < 0:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

    return result

# Example usage
nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
print(three_sum(nums))  # Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]

Explanation:
Two Pointer Mechanism: After sorting the array, two pointers (left and right) are used to traverse from both ends towards the middle, allowing us to efficiently find triplets that sum to zero.
Why Focus on This: The ability to reduce the problem complexity from O(n^3) (brute force) to O(n^2) using sorting and two pointers is a critical optimization interviewers look for in candidates.

4. Top K Frequent Elements (Heap or Bucket Sort)
Code:
python
Copy code
from collections import Counter
import heapq

def top_k_frequent(nums, k):
    # Create a frequency map of the numbers
    freq_map = Counter(nums)

    # Use a heap to get the k most frequent elements
    return heapq.nlargest(k, freq_map.keys(), key=freq_map.get)

# Example usage
nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
k = 2
print(top_k_frequent(nums, k))  # Output: [1, 2]

Explanation:
Heap Mechanism: The frequency of each element is calculated using Counter, and then a max-heap (via heapq.nlargest) is used to get the top k elements in O(n log k) time.
Why Focus on This: This problem helps you practice using heaps and dictionaries together, a common interview combination for frequency-related tasks.

5. Search in Rotated Sorted Array (Binary Search)
Code:
python
Copy code
def search(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        # If target is found, return the index
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid

        # Determine the sorted half
        if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:  # Left side is sorted
            if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        else:  # Right side is sorted
            if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1

    return -1

# Example usage
nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
target = 0
print(search(nums, target))  # Output: 4

Explanation:
Binary Search Mechanism:
    By identifying which half of the array is sorted in each iteration, we can determine whether to move left or right, despite the rotation.

Teacher's Suggestions for Study:
Hash Maps:
    Focus on questions that use dictionaries/hash maps, as they are essential in Python coding interviews. The two_sum problem is a great example of how to efficiently use O(1) lookups.

Sliding Window:
    Master sliding window problems like longest_substring_without_repeating_charactersâ€”this pattern shows up frequently in string manipulation questions.

Two Pointers:
    Get comfortable with problems like three_sum where sorting combined with two pointers optimizes brute force solutions.
Heaps: Understanding how to use heapq for top-K problems will prepare you for frequency and ranking questions.

Binary Search:
    Study variations of binary search. It's a versatile algorithm used in many different contexts, such as searching in rotated sorted arrays or finding elements in unknown orderings.
